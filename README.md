The goal of this project is to implement a workload generator. The Python script gen_workload.py is used to create workloads for testing key-value store implementations. The script generates a workload.txt file containing a series of requests, with each line formatted as <request type> <key> <value>. It also creates a solution.txt file, which lists the results of the get requests in the same order.
